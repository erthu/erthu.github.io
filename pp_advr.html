          Your privacy is important to us. It is Eric Thullen (ErThu)'s policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including across our website, <a href="index.html">https://erthu.de</a>, and our game Ancient Dungeon and Ancient Dungeon Beta.
          <br><br>
          This policy is effective as of 1 September 2021 and was last updated on 1 September 2021.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Information We Collect</strong><br>
          Information we collect includes both information you knowingly and actively provide us when using or participating in any of our services and promotions, and any information automatically sent by your devices in the course of accessing our products and services.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Ancient Dungeon</strong><br>
          Ancient Dungeon and Ancient Dungeon Beta do not collect any personal information. The only information that is collected is <em>anonymous analytics data</em>, which cannot be used to identify you personally. This data may include:
          <br>
          - Which in-game items (pickups) are collected<br>
          - The in-game floor on which your character dies<br>
          - The number of runs you have completed
          <br><br>
          <strong>How We Use This Data</strong><br>
          We use this anonymous gameplay data solely for:
          <br>1. <strong>Game Improvement</strong>: Analyzing gameplay patterns (e.g., which items are collected or how far players progress) to balance and enhance the game experience.
          <br>2. <strong>Analytics &amp; Performance</strong>: Aggregating data to understand player engagement, identify bugs, and optimize performance across different devices.
          <br>3. <strong>No Personalized Advertising</strong>: We do <em>not</em> use any data collected to serve personalized advertisements.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Third-Party Services</strong><br>
          We may use third-party analytics tools to process and store the anonymized gameplay data. These third-party tools have access only to anonymized usage data for the purpose of providing analytics services to us and must adhere to data protection standards. If you would like more details about these specific services, please contact us at the email address below.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Data Retention for Ancient Dungeon</strong><br>
          We retain anonymous gameplay data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes listed above (e.g., improving the game and troubleshooting). Afterward, the data is either deleted or maintained in an aggregated form that does not identify you.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Log Data</strong><br>
          When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log the standard data provided by your web browser.

          When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.
          <br><br>
          Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data security. We will comply with laws applicable to us in respect of any data breach.

          We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This time period may depend on what we are using your information for, in accordance with this privacy policy. If your personal information is no longer required, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you.
